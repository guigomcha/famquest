# Implementation decisions

## Deployment 

Directly over K8s in kind for practice.

## Language

### Frontend

Good oportunity to develop a bit of javascript. React JS seems to be the easiest

## Backends

- Golang for Basic DB interactions: Speed, clean, learn SQL
  + https://blog.logrocket.com/building-simple-app-go-postgresql/
  + https://www.sqliz.com/posts/golang-gorm-postgresql/
  + Admin UI https://github.com/techwithgates/goadmin?

- Python for more complex data processing

## Database

### Redis 

Drawbacks:

- RAM memory is always more expensive than disk. 
- The app is not concerned about real-time.
- Main storage will be relational data + multi-media which might not be ideal for redis

Decision:

- Could eventually be used as message broker and adopted for client side cache 

### PostgreSQL

For relational data. 

### Multi-media storage

I need an object storage in disk to optimize storage.

# Data models

Relational Db based on golang structs

# Workflows

Start
- Maps manager receives the map center, resolution and zoom, the user location is taken from DB:
  + Find out what resource Ids are needed to be available in the UI
  + Provide the location history to hide the rest of the locations

Refresh periodically (and at start):
- location sent to map manager periodically, map worker updates user location and history 

Anytime:
- User clicks and Frontend talks directly to the Db manager

Open Profile:
- Load progress bars

Cronjobs:
- request location data to load user's history
