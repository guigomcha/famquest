  "coreObjective1": "Each family member can contribute with new locations of interest or to existing ones.",

  "coreObjective3": "Each note provides a description, photos, audios, (soon also videos) to fully describe what happened there.",
  "coreObjective4": "Each family member may also provide notes as part of their profile to provide information not directly associated to a location, such as family drama, cooking recipes, life lessons learned...",
  "coreObjective5": "In <strong>adventure mode</strong>, a location (soon also notes) can be \"discovered\" based on the user GPS history or fixed date so that you gradually unveil what your family experienced in a location as you pass by there.",
  "coreObjective6": "In <strong>display mode</strong>, all contributions can be visualized as a digital photo frame or explored manually with no restrictions.",
