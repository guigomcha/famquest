  "introText": "''<b>FamQuest</b>'' is born as the 1-year bday present for my first nephew, Jaime, with the initial objective of telling my story in his city as he discovers it (I live in a different city now). It has eventually grown out to host the story of the whole family around the world, <b>as a location-based media-storage application</b> that is similar to a very private family photo album and journal shared between family members, keeping it very clear that <b>this is not another social network</b>. It is a way to share memories and pass them down in this new era of technology, lack of family time and globalization.",
  "coreObjectivesTitle": "Some of the core objectives:",
  "coreObjective1": "Your family members pre-populate your world with memories from their past. E.g., old family house, school, important trips, where the parents met...",
  "coreObjective2": "The target user has to physically be in a spot to visualize something (or prove it via google-maps). The map of the world is not fully visible, you have to discover it 'fog-of-war-style' (age-of-empire). E.g., A notification alerts the user of a new spot found.",
  "coreObjective3": "Older generations have a way to quickly record an audio describing a spot or photo so that their voices can be heard by future generations of the family.",
  "coreObjective4": "Keep lists of things that would be nice to be shared at a later time. E.g., Important movies, tips and tricks...",
  "coreObjective5": "Each family will be able to host their own instance of the application on an old laptop/miniPC without the need to sell off their private memories to a big tech.",
